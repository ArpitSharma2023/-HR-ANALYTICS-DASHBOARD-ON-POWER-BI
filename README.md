Hi Connection's! Finally I done project :- An Interactive Attrition Dashboard in Power BI
I am thrilled to introduce my most recent undertaking, an interactive Attrition Dashboard crafted in Power BI, designed to aid organizations on how to handle employee retention. Attrition - the occurance of employees leaving a company over time - is a crucial measure of organizational health, often indicating the effectiveness of HR policies and employee satisfaction.
Power BI and Attrition Analysis Through the lens of this dynamic dashboard, HR teams can gain in-depth insights into attrition rates, unveiling patterns and potential hotspots for concern. A standout feature is the ability to filter the data across three crucial departments: HR, R&D, and Sales. This enables a close examination of department-specific trends, providing invaluable data for customizing strategies aimed at boosting employee retention.
